==============================================================================
GNU development environment and installation procedure (Cygwin)
==============================================================================

------------------------------
1. Installing Cygwin system
------------------------------

Install Cygwin if the Cygwin system is not installed in the Windows
yet.  Note that this development environment doesn't work correctly
with the Cygwin version older than the 1.5 series.

Log on the Windows as a user who has the administrator privilege to
perform the Cygwin installation.

Copy (save) the installation file develop\cygwin_d-1.7.7-1.zip of
Cygwin onto the root of the drive to be installed (C:\, etc.).

Next, right-click on the saved file on the Windows "Explorer," and
execute "Expand all" of the menu.

Then, there is an installer "setup.exe" in the expanded directory.
Double-click on this "setup.exe" to start the installer.  Press 
"Next (N)>" after the installer window opens.

Select "Install from Local Directory" and press "Next (N)>."

Specify where to put the root directory of Cygwin on the Windows.
The default setting is C:\cygwin.  Set it to default if there is no
problem.

Select "All Users" for "Install For."  This is also the default
setting.  Press "Next (N)>."

Specify the directory that holds the expanded content of
cygwin_d-1.7.7-1.zip for "Local Package Directory."  When "Next (N)>"
is pressed, the file will be checked.

After a while, the "Setup Alert" dialog is displayed when the Cygwin
1.7 series is first installed.  When the Cygwin 1.7 series is
installed, it overwrites the previous version of Cygwin in use. This
may result in some adverse effects. Therefore, proceed after reading
the WARNING carefully.

Next, the selection screen of the installation packages is displayed.
The installation begins if "Default" of "All () Default" is clicked,
and the state is changed to "Install," and "Next (N)>" is pressed.

When you are asked at the end whether icons need to be created for the
desktop and the start menu, press "Completion" to exit the installer.

The dialogu, "This program may have not been correctly installed", may
be displayed according to the Windows version after the installation.
In this case, press "This program has been properly installed."

------------------------------
2. Setting after Cygwin installation
------------------------------

Modify the batch file for starting Cygwin as the administrator who
has installed Cygwin after the installation is completed.

The root directory of Cygwin is C:\cygwin when it is seen from the
Windows.  For instance, the directory represented as /usr on cygwin is
the folder of C:\cygwin\usr when it is seen from the Windows Explorer.

In the Cygwin default state, the file name is case-insensitive.
However, as this may cause a trouble, change the configuration to the
case-sensitive setting.  As a concrete procedure, open
C:\cygwin\Cygwin.bat with the text editor. (This is the batch file to
be executed to start Cygwin.)

Add the following line 

    set CYGWIN=check_case:strict

before

    bash --login -i

in the batch file.

Double-click on the "Cygwin" icon of desktop to start Cygwin after
modifying the batch file.  The home directory is initialized during
the first starup.

Next, perl is configured so that it can be started by invoking
/usr/local/bin/perl.  Provide the symbolic link from /usr/local/bin to
/usr/bin/perl.

	cd /usr/local/bin
	ln -s /usr/bin/perl

Input exit on the console to exit Cygwin. 

If the user who has installed it and the user who actually uses it are
different, start Cygwin by logging off from the Windows once, logging
in again as a user who actually uses it, and double-clicking the
"Cygwin" icon of desktop.  User's home directory is initialized during
the first startup.

Edit /home/username/.bashrc for ease of use to suit user's needs.

This concludes the Cygwin installation.

Delete the cygwin_d-1.7.7-1.zip file used for the installation as it
is not needed after the installation is completed.

------------------------------
3. Creating a directory
------------------------------

Create the directory that holds the development environment.  In this
document, it is assumed that the development environment is installed
in /usr/local/tef_em1d.

Example:
    $ mkdir /usr/local/tef_em1d

    * If GNU development environment for other T-Kernels has already
      been installed, install this development environment in a
      different directory.  If it is installed in the same directory,
      it may cause a trouble.

    * The administrator privilege is required to create
      /usr/local/tef_em1d, as the owner of /usr/local is usually the
      administrator who has installed Cygwin.  After creating
      /usr/local/tef_em1d, set the owner and the permission
      appropriately so that the user who does the T-Kernel development
      work can access it.

------------------------------
4. Expanding the development environment package
------------------------------

GNU development environment package is now expanded in
/usr/local/tef_em1d.

First, copy the following .tar.gz files under the develop directory of
this package onto the C:\cygwin\usr\local\ tef_em1d directory by using
the Windows Explorer, etc.

    te.Cygwin-i686.arm_2.1.0.1.tar.gz
    te.Cygwin-i686.common.12.tar.gz

Next, execute the following command on the Cygwin console, and expand
each package.

    Example:
	$ cd /usr/local/tef_em1d
        $ tar zxpf te.Cygwin-i686.arm_2.1.0.1.tar.gz
        $ tar zxpf te.Cygwin-i686.common.12.tar.gz

Delete the above *.tar.gz files as they are not needed after the
package is expanded.

------------------------------
5. Setting environment variable
------------------------------

When the compilation and the build of the T-Kernel are done by not
using Eclipse, but using only Cygwin, it is necessary to set the
following environment variables.  Edit /home/username/.bashrc, and add
the following commands in it.

- Setting the environment variable GNU_BD and GNUARM_2 to do
  compilation and build

    Example: 
        export GNU_BD=/usr/local/tef_em1d/tool/Cygwin-i686
        export GNUARM_2=$GNU_BD/arm_2-unknown-tkernel

- Setting the environment variable BD that shows the top directory of
  the T-Kernel source

    Example:
        export BD=/usr/local/tef_em1d/tkernel_source

  * Change the path names properly according to each one's
    environment.  The setting to .bashrc will become effective at the
    time of next restart.  Restart Cygwin if Cygwin is used
    continuously after .bashrc is edited.  It is not necessary to set
    the environment variables as above when Eclipse is used.
